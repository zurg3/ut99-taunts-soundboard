# Unreal Tournament (1999) - Russian taunts soundboard
The purpose of this project is to present original and Russian (from unofficial localization by "Русский проект") taunts from the game Unreal Tournament (1999) for comparison and bring good old memories to Russian-speaking players.

Notes:
- The taunts are presented as the tables for each player (for clarity).
- You can play audios of Russian taunts. I suppose I don't have the rights to use the original audios in this project. But "Русский проект" most likely no longer exists.
- I'm not the author of taunts text and audio. I'm sorry if taunts offended someone.
